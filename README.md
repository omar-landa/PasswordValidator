# PasswordValidator

A password validator written while learning Java.

This program was made by creating a series of functions to receive user input and
to check the user input against predetermined rules. The rules for the new password
are as follows:

    The password must be at least 8 characters long.
    The password must contain an uppercase letter.
    The password must contain a special character.
    The password must not contain the username.
    The password must not be the same as the old password.
    
This allowed me to practice using various concepts, such as for loops, 
if/else statements, and booleans.

This also allowed me to practice calling the functions I have created.
